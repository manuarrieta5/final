		<h1>Spatial Intelligence</h1>
		
			<p>Spatial intelligence features the potential to recognize and manipulate the patterns of wide space (those used, for instance, by navigators and pilots) as well as the patterns of more confined areas, such as those of importance to sculptors, surgeons, chess players, graphic artists, or architects.
			</p>

			<p>People with spatial intelligence, such as Frank Lloyd Wright and Amelia Earhart, have an ability to recognize and manipulate large-scale and fine-grained spatial images.
			</p>

			<ul>Some potential careers could be:
				<li>Pilot</li>
				<li>Surgeon</li>
				<li>Architect</li>
				<li>Graphic Artist</li>
				<li>Interior Decorator</li>
